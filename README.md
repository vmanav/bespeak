## About

bespeak is a REST API ticket booking interface for Zomentum Hiring Assignment.


## Description of the Problem Statement

You have to design a REST interface for a movie theatre ticket booking system. It should
support the following business cases:
- An endpoint to book a ticket using a user‚Äôs name, phone number, and timings.
- An endpoint to update a ticket timing.
- An endpoint to view all the tickets for a particular time.
- An endpoint to delete a particular ticket.
- An endpoint to view the user‚Äôs details based on the ticket id.
- Mark a ticket as expired if there is a diff of 8 hours between the ticket timing and current
time.

- Note: For a particular timing, a maximum of 20 tickets can be booked.
- You should follow the REST paradigm while building your application.
- You can use any database you like.
- Create a proper readme for your project.
